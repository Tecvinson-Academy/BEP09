Proposal for BEP09 Bootcamp Manager  

Objective:  
The proposed system is designed to streamline the management of student enrollment and course 
administration for bootcamps. The primary goal is to optimize administrative efficiency while 
ensuring that data is accurately maintained and easily accessible.  

Target Users:  
The target users for BEP09 Bootcamp Manager are administrators of coding bootcamps and similar 
intensive educational programs. These users require a specialized system that simplifies 
enrollment and student data management. This application addresses the unique demands of 
bootcamp environments, where rapid enrollment and flexible course management are critical.  

Core features and functionalities:  
1. Create New Students  
Student registration feature where administrators can input new student details, such as name, 
contact information, date of birth and selected courses.  

2. Unique Student ID Generation: The system automatically generates a unique student ID upon 
registration, which is used to track and manage all related data.  

3. Validation and Error Handling: The system checks for duplicate entries, missing fields, and 
ensures that all required information is provided before successfully registering a new student.  

4. Viewing Student Information: This feature provides a comprehensive list that displays all 
enrolled students with key details like name, student ID, courses enrolled etc  

5. Updating Student Information: Administrators can update student information such as change 
of name, contact details and course enrollments. The system allows administrators to add or 
remove courses for a student, reflecting changes in their academic plan.  

6. Course Enrollment Management: The system allows administrators to assign students to 
specific courses, track enrollment numbers, and manage course capacities.   

UNIQUE VALUE PROPOSITION: 

1. Enhanced Security Features:  
Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) combined with data encryption to ensure secure 
access and storage of sensitive student information. 

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Access to different functionalities and data within the 
Bootcamp Manager is based on user roles. For example, only administrators can add or remove 
students, while instructors may only access course assignments and student performance data. 

2. Data Encryption: Encrypt sensitive data, such as personal student information and course 
enrollment details, both at rest and in transit. This ensures that even if data is intercepted 
or accessed without authorization, it remains unreadable and secure. 

Feasibility: RBAC can be implemented by defining roles and permissions within the application 
logic, while encryption can be achieved using libraries like cryptography in Python. These 
security features are crucial for protecting user data and can be implemented within the 
existing backend-focused development scope. 

3. Progress Tracking and Reporting: 
This is a feature for automated progress tracking and reporting that provides administrators 
with insights into student performance and course engagement.  

Progress Tracking: Track student progress through their enrolled courses by recording key 
milestones such as completed assignments, quizzes, and participation in assessments. This 
data can be displayed in a dashboard for administrators. 

Feasibility: This feature can be integrated by adding additional fields to track progress
related data and using Python’s reporting libraries (like ReportLab) to generate reports. 
It enhances the administrative efficiency of the system by providing actionable insights 
without manual tracking. 

Technology Stack:   

   - Programming Language: Python   
   - Testing: PyTest or UnitTest for testing the application functionalities.   

Development Phases:   

   - Phase 1: Requirements gathering and system design.   
   - Phase 2: Develop the core functionalities.   
   - Phase 3: Testing and debugging.   
   - Phase 4: Deployment  

MEETING PROJECT CRITERIA:  
1. Feasibility:  
   The current focus of BEP09 Bootcamp Manager is on developing the backend code, with 
student information stored in selected data structures. The project leverages simple 
python based techniques for backend development, ensuring that the core functionalities 
can be implemented effectively within the given timeframe of 2 weeks.  

2. Niche Market Proposition:  
   BEP09 Bootcamp Manager sets itself apart from general educational management systems 
by focusing exclusively on the operational needs of bootcamps. The system’s niche market 
proposition lies in its ability to handle the fast-paced, dynamic environment of 
bootcamps, offering functionalities that align with the specific requirements of these 
programs. Unlike broader educational management solutions, BEP09 Bootcamp Manager is 
designed to be lightweight, flexible, and responsive.  

3. Marketability:  
   The bootcamp industry is expanding rapidly due to the growing demand for skill-based 
education, making BEP09 Bootcamp Manager highly marketable. The system’s ability to 
simplify and enhance administrative processes makes it an attractive option for bootcamp 
operators. It is also relatively lightweight and a cost attractive option that should 
appeal to startup training enterprises.  

4. Growth Potential:  
BEP09 Bootcamp Manager is designed with scalability in mind, offering significant 
potential for future growth. The system can be expanded to include a web-based front-end 
interface. Additionally, the incorporation of a relational database for storing student 
and course information can further strengthen the system’s capabilities, allowing for 
more complex queries and data management. Another feasible expansion avenue is the 
addition of a payment platform where students or parents can make secure financial 
payments for courses to be studied by students, with an automated receipt generator 
sending evidence of payment via email.
